    "Home construction in Jacksonville has had multiple boom and bust periods. After reaching a peak of more than 6,000 homes constructed in 1960, home construction plummeted to about 1,200 by 1967, a total drop of 80% and an annualized decrease of about 11.5%. The market hit another peak of almost 5,600 in 2005 before dropping to 871 in 2011, a total decrease of 84.5% and an annualized decrease of 14.1%.\n",

In the map below, the oldest 50% of homes are colored blue, with the darker shade being the oldest quartile. Some of the oldest districts include San Marco, Avondale, Springfield, the Beaches and Arlington.\n",

In the map below, the youngest 50% of homes are colored green, with the darker shade being the youngest quartile.\n",

    "Jacksonville's most valuable land, irrespective of the buildings on them, are the beaches, the zip code encompassing the Avondale and Ortega historic districts along the river and in the Southern zip codes closest to St. Johns County. The least valuable land is located between downtown and the airport, followed closely by the westernmost zipcodes.\n",

    "\n",
    "This makes intuitive sense, as Jacksonville's buildings are least valuable where people are most concentrated and most valuable where people are least concentrated - that is, buildings are most valuable where land is cheap and therefore buildings tend to be larger. Houses built farthest from downtown, the St. Johns River and the ocean also tend to be younger than those built close to these areas, another reason for their higher building values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jacksonville's existing inventory is largest in Northside, Arlington, along the Intracoastal Waterway and to the southwest of downtown. Construction in recent years, 2017 to 2019, has been highest in Northside and Westside. This mostly inverse relationship is unsurprising; builders are going where land is cheap and readily available, but still proximal to existing concentrations of homes. Only Northside has both a high number of homes and a high number of recently built homes."

    "\n",
    "The Duval County Property Appraiser, since taxes are levied by parcel, assesses the just value of entire parcels, regardless of the number of buildings on them. To determine the values of each home on a parcel with multiple homes, I therefore calculated an adjusted value. This adjustment takes the ratio of a home's gross square feet to the total gross square feet of buildings in the parcel, applies this ratio to the land value of the parcel, then adds the building value and feature value of each particular building.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 10 most valuable homes by this calculation are listed below and range in value from $4.7 million to $9.1 million. Each has access to water - the majority to the ocean and the minority to the St. Johns River. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 10 most valuable neighborhoods are those in the Beaches, San Marco, Avondale and Ortega. Each of these neighborhoods is located along water and has historic stock. This likely reflects not only the value of being near water but also the fact that those who can afford to buy waterfront property can typically afford to invest heavily into the homes as well. Indeed, buildings exposed to the effects of salt water and in historic districts require extensive upkeep and renovations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 10 least valuable neighborhoods are landlocked, adjacent to interstates and industrial areas and are closer to areas of downtown blight than areas of downtown revitalization. The neighborhoods are composed of old homes that have not received the significant renovation dollars of the Avondale, Ortega and San Marco historic districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "That age plays a major role in home valuations is clear from the map of neighborhood median adjusted values below. The most valuable 50% of homes are in green, with dark green depicting the most valuable quartile. The least valuable 50% of homes are in gray, with the darkest shade depicting the least valuable quartile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most recently constructed homes, located along the Intracoastal Waterway to the east, in Fleming Island and near St. Johns County to the south, in the far west of Westside and towards Nassau County to the north are all green, while the oldest stock of homes in Arlington, between downtown and the airport and in Westside are all black. \n",

    "\n",
    "The oceanfront characteristic is associated with the most valuable homes. This makes sense as oceanfront land is the most valuable land in Jacksonville, the supply of homes (317) is smaller than any of the other top characteristics and the proximity to the ocean requires extensive upkeep, as shown by the fact that the median effective age of oceanfront homes is 42 years younger than the median age of oceanfront homes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Oceanfront homes are also large. These homes are tied with homes along the St. Johns River for the most median bedrooms and bathrooms with four of each, and the median heated square feet of oceanfront homes are 2nd only to homes along the St. Johns River. Proximity to the St. Johns River is unsurprisingly the 2nd most valuable of the 10 most common characteristics. Ocean frontage still outweighs river frontage, however, as both the median adjusted value per gross square foot and the median adjusted value per heated square foot of oceanfront homes vastly exceed those of homes along the river - or along canals, lakes and miscellaneous waterways.\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously noted, homes in historic districts have been extensively renovated, as shown by a significant difference between their respective median ages and median effective ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Springfield is associated with the least valuable homes of the 10 most common characteristics. That is not to say it is associated with homes that are not valuable. In fact, Springfield is the exception to the rule within its surroundings. Springfield is located immediately north of downtown, in close proximity to the neighborhoods shown in a previous map to be Jacksonville's 10 least valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike its neighbors, Springfield has benefited from a period of revitalization helped by historic tax credits, low interest or interest-free loans from nonprofits and other incentivized funding. Its affordability compared to downtown's other satellite neighborhoods and a multi-year period of downtown redevelopment have added wind to its sails, though whether that momentum continues after the financial ramifications of the Covid-19 pandemic remains to be seen."

There are fewer than 350 three-story homes in Jacksonville.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, single-story homes have the smallest median home value. This may be a result of the type's commonality - every other kind of home type is comparatively rare. Having more than one story may also be an indicator of a home's proximity to water, downtown and other valuable areas, since they have higher concentrations of buildings and would be more likely to justify vertical construction. It also may be an indication of a younger home, since more than one story can presumably be associated with later stages of an area's development, newer construction methods and/or more recent aesthetic preferences."
